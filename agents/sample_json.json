The goal is to drive lead magnets → newsletter → paid workshops.\n\nCould you review and comment by Friday 5 PM? In particular:\n- Are the learn-by-doing topics aligned with search trends?\n- Any guest speakers we should line up?\n- Budget check for two paid promo experiments (\\$250 each).\n\nIf helpful, I can record a 10-minute Loom walk-through.Also, i was wondering. what's the price range for building a Cross-Platform App with flutter.\n\nThanks a bunch,\nRosius",
